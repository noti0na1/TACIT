# Project Falcon — Acquisition Proposal

**Classification:** Board Confidential
**Prepared by:** M. Chen, VP Corporate Development
**Date:** 2024-12-01
**Status:** Under NDA — Do Not Distribute

## Target

**DataFlow Systems, Inc.**
- Founded: 2019, San Francisco, CA
- Employees: 142
- Revenue (2024 est.): $28.5M ARR
- Key product: Real-time data pipeline platform with 340+ enterprise customers

## Strategic Rationale

DataFlow's streaming engine would close the gap in our real-time analytics offering. Their customer base has minimal overlap with ours (estimated 8% overlap). Integrating their technology would reduce our time-to-market for the "Live Insights" roadmap item by approximately 18 months.

Key assets:
- 14 patents in stream processing and exactly-once delivery
- Engineering team of 67, including 4 former Google Cloud Dataflow engineers
- SOC 2 Type II certified; HIPAA-compliant deployment option
- Go-to-market motion in financial services vertical (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citadel among customers)

## Valuation

Based on comparable transactions and DCF analysis:

| Method | Valuation |
|--------|-----------|
| Revenue multiple (12x ARR) | $342M |
| DCF (10-year, 15% discount) | $298M |
| Comparable transactions | $310M–$380M |

**Recommended offer range:** $320M–$350M
**Expected counter:** $380M–$420M
**Walk-away price:** $400M

## Deal Structure

- 70% cash / 30% stock (4-year lockup)
- $15M retention pool for key engineering talent (18-month cliff)
- Earnout: additional $30M if revenue targets met in Year 1 ($35M) and Year 2 ($50M)
- CEO (R. Patel) offered SVP role reporting to CTO

## Risks

1. **Key-person risk:** CTO (L. Zhang) holds 3 of 14 patents and may not stay post-acquisition
2. **Customer concentration:** Top 5 customers = 38% of revenue
3. **Technical debt:** Legacy Java codebase for core engine; rewrite to Rust in progress (60% complete)
4. **Regulatory:** FTC review possible given combined market share in data pipeline space (~22%)

## Timeline

- Dec 15: Board approval to proceed with LOI
- Jan 5: LOI delivered
- Jan 15–Mar 15: Due diligence (60 days)
- Apr 1: Definitive agreement target
- Jun 1: Close (pending regulatory)

## Financing

Cash component ($224M–$245M) funded from:
- Operating cash reserves: $180M
- Revolving credit facility: $44M–$65M (drawn at SOFR + 175bps)
